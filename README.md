Folder contains the dataset that is used (letter.data).

->Rrun the code from the beginning.

-> Also, the dataset needs to place in sample_data folder. Below are the names of files I used â€“

**Abstract**
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of words in images has huge practical applications. 
This work studies the utility of different machine learning as well as deep learning models for the task of OCR. 
The simplest approach to OCR is to recognize each character individually. 
Typical machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to recognize the individual characters. 
But if we are recognizing characters in a word, then the probability of a character appearing after certain characters (language models) give additional clue in the prediction of that character. 
So we can also implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) based model for the OCR system. The models are trained using a dataset of handwritten words provided. 
The performance of a model is evaluated using various metrics such as character level accuracy as well as word-level accuracy.
